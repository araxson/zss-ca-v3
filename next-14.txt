[h1] Next.js 14
[p] As we announced at  Next.js Conf   , Next.js 14 is our most focused release with:
[li] Turbopack: 5,000 tests passing for App & Pages Router
[li] 53% faster local server startup
[li] 94% faster code updates with Fast Refresh
[li] Server Actions (Stable): Progressively enhanced mutations
[li] Integrated with caching & revalidating
[li] Simple function calls, or works natively with forms
[li] Partial Prerendering (Preview): Fast initial static response + streaming dynamic content
[li] Next.js Learn (New): Free course teaching the App Router, authentication, databases, and more.
[p] Upgrade today or get started with:
[h2] Next.js Compiler: Turbocharged
[p] Since Next.js 13, we've been working to improve local development performance in Next.js in both the Pages and App Router.
[p] Previously, we were rewriting  next dev and other parts of Next.js to support this effort. We have since changed our approach to be more incremental. This means our Rust-based compiler will reach stability soon, as we've refocused on supporting all Next.js features first.
[p] 5,000 integration tests for  next dev are now passing with  Turbopack   , our underlying Rust engine. These tests include 7 years of bug fixes and reproductions.
[p] While testing on  vercel.com, a large Next.js application, we've seen:
[li] Up to  53.3% faster local server startup
[li] Up to  94.7% faster code updates with Fast Refresh
[p] This benchmark is a practical result of performance improvements you should expect with a large application (and large module graph). With 90% of tests for  next dev now passing, you should see faster and more reliable performance consistently when using  next dev --turbo.
[p] Once we hit 100% of tests passing, we'll move Turbopack to stable in an upcoming minor release. We'll also continue to support using webpack for custom configurations and ecosystem plugins.
[p] You can follow the percentage of tests passing at  areweturboyet.com   .
[h2] Forms and Mutations
[p] Next.js 9 introduced API Routes—a way to quickly build backend endpoints alongside your frontend code.
[p] For example, you would create a new file in the  api/ directory:
[p] Then, on the client-side, you could use React and an event handler like  onSubmit to make a  fetch to your API Route.
[p] Now with Next.js 14, we want to simplify the developer experience of authoring data mutations. Further, we want to improve the user experience when the user has a slow network connection, or when submitting a form from a lower-powered device.
[h3] Server Actions (Stable)
[p] What if you didn't need to manually create an API Route? Instead, you could define a function that runs securely on the server, called directly from your React components.
[p] The App Router is built on the React  canary channel, which is  stable for frameworks    to adopt new features. As of v14, Next.js has upgraded to the latest React  canary, which includes stable Server Actions.
[p] The previous example from the Pages Router can be simplified to one file:
[p] Server Actions should feel familiar for any developers who have previously used server-centric frameworks in the past. It's built on web fundamentals like forms and the  FormData Web API   .
[p] While using Server Actions through a form is helpful for progressive enhancement, it is not a requirement. You can also call them directly as a function, without a form. When using TypeScript, this gives you full end-to-end type-safety between the client and server.
[p] Mutating data, re-rendering the page, or redirecting can happen in  one network roundtrip, ensuring the correct data is displayed on the client, even if the upstream provider is slow. Further, you can compose and reuse different actions, including many different actions in the same route.
[h3] Caching, Revalidating, Redirecting, and more
[p] Server Actions are deeply integrated into the entire App Router model. You can:
[li] Revalidate cached data with  revalidatePath() or  revalidateTag()
[li] Redirect to different routes through  redirect()
[li] Set and read cookies through  cookies()
[li] Handle optimistic UI updates with  useOptimistic()
[li] Catch and display errors from the server with  useFormState()
[li] Display loading states on the client with  useFormStatus()
[p] Learn more about  Forms and Mutations with Server Actions    or about the  security model    and best practices for Server Components and Server Actions.
[h2] Partial Prerendering (Preview)
[p] We'd like to share a preview of Partial Prerendering — a compiler optimization for dynamic content with a fast initial static response — that we're working on for Next.js.
[p] Partial Prerendering builds on a decade of research and development into server-side rendering (SSR), static-site generation (SSG), and incremental static revalidation (ISR).
[h3] Motivation
[p] We've heard your feedback. There's currently too many runtimes, configuration options, and rendering methods to have to consider. You want the speed and reliability of static, while also supporting fully dynamic, personalized responses.
[p] Having great performance globally  and personalization shouldn't come at the cost of complexity.
[p] Our challenge was to create a better developer experience, simplifying the existing model without introducing new APIs for developers to learn. While partial caching of server-side content has existed, these approaches still need to meet the developer experience and composability goals we aim for.
[p] Partial Prerendering requires no new APIs to learn.
[h3] Built on React Suspense
[p] Partial Prerendering is defined by your Suspense boundaries. Here's how it works. Consider the following ecommerce page:
[p] With Partial Prerendering enabled, this page generates a static shell based on your  <Suspense /> boundaries. The  fallback from React Suspense is prerendered.
[p] Suspense fallbacks in the shell are then replaced with dynamic components, like reading cookies to determine the cart, or showing a banner based on the user.
[p] When a request is made, the static HTML shell is immediately served:
[p] Since  <ShoppingCart /> reads from  cookies to look at the user session, this component is then streamed in as part of the same HTTP request as the static shell. There are no extra network roundtrips needed.
[p] To have the most granular static shell, this may require adding additional Suspense boundaries. However, if you're already using  loading.js today, this is an implicit Suspense boundary, so no changes would be required to generate the static shell.
[h3] Coming soon
[p] Partial prerendering is under active development. We'll be sharing more updates in an upcoming minor release.
[h2] Metadata Improvements
[p] Before your page content can be streamed from the server, there's important metadata about the viewport, color scheme, and theme that need to be sent to the browser first.
[p] Ensuring these  meta tags are sent with the initial page content helps a smooth user experience, preventing the page from flickering by changing the theme color, or shifting layout due to viewport changes.
[p] In Next.js 14, we've decoupled blocking and non-blocking metadata. Only a small subset of metadata options are blocking, and we want to ensure non-blocking metadata will not prevent a partially prerendered page from serving the static shell.
[p] The following metadata options are now deprecated and will be removed from  metadata in a future major version:
[li] viewport: Sets the initial zoom and other properties of the viewport
[li] colorScheme: Sets the support modes (light/dark) for the viewport
[li] themeColor: Sets the color the chrome around the viewport should render with
[p] Starting with Next.js 14, there are new options   viewport and  generateViewport    to replace these options. All other  metadata options remain the same.
[p] You can start adopting these new APIs today. The existing  metadata options will continue to work.
