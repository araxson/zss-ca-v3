# Pricing Strategy & Marketing Copy

## üéØ Market Reality Check

**Honest Assessment:** The original $149-$999/month pricing is **challenging** for most small businesses.

### Why Small Business Owners Hesitate:

1. **Mental Accounting** - They compare to:
   - Wix Pro: $27 CAD/month
   - Squarespace: $23-$65 CAD/month
   - One-time website: $2,000-$5,000 (feels like "owning" it)

2. **Cash Flow Sensitivity** - Most small businesses have tight margins
   - $149/month = $1,788/year (seems expensive for "just a website")
   - Could pay an employee for that money

3. **Value Perception Gap** - They don't see difference between:
   - "My nephew can build it for $500"
   - Professional ongoing service

4. **Economic Uncertainty** - Recurring costs are scary commitments

## ‚ùì FAQ - "Why Not Just Build It Once?"

**Q: Why pay monthly instead of buying a website outright?**

**A:** Great question! Here's what happens with traditional "one-time" websites:

| Traditional One-Time Site | Our Subscription Model |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Pay $3,000-$10,000 upfront | Start at $97/month, no upfront cost |
| Need changes? Pay $100-$200/hour | Unlimited updates included |
| Security updates? Your problem | We handle security, backups, updates |
| Site breaks? Pay to fix | We fix it, no extra charge |
| Hosting, domain, SSL = extra fees | Everything included |
| Outdated in 1-2 years | Always fresh, modern, optimized |

**Reality:** Most "one-time" sites cost $2,000-$5,000/year in maintenance, hosting, and updates anyway.

**Our Promise:** You pay $97-$797/month and *everything* is handled. Forever. No surprises.

## ‚úÖ Final Recommendation

**Start with this pricing.** Here's why:

1. **Competitive Entry Point** - $97 beats Wix/Squarespace on value
2. **Clear Upgrade Path** - Natural progression as businesses grow
3. **Sustainable Margins** - Enough to deliver quality + profit
4. **Market Tested** - Similar to successful agencies (Duda, Weblium, B12)

**Adjust later** based on:
- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Lifetime value (LTV)
- Churn rate
- Support load

**The goal:** LTV should be 3x CAC. If your CAC is $300 (ads, sales time), aim for customers staying 9+ months on Growth plan = $1,773 LTV.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Validate with 5-10 potential customers (friends, family, local businesses)
2. Ask: "Would you pay $X/month for this?" (don't explain, just listen)
3. Launch Essential + Growth only (simplify choice)
4. Add Pro/Elite after 20 customers (you'll know what they need)

*Remember: Pricing isn't permanent. It's a hypothesis. Test, learn, adjust.* üöÄ
