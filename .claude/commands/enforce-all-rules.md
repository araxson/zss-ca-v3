# Enforce All Rules - Sequential Audit & Fix

**ULTRATHINK** through the entire enforcement process. Run **9 enforcer agents sequentially** for each multipile times in paralel to each specific part to audit and fix violations against all rule files.

---

## Mission

Use all tools to Execute all enforcer agents in order to detect and **FIX** violations across the entire codebase. Each agent reads its corresponding rule file, runs detection commands, and fixes violations directly in code.

**CRITICAL:** This is a FIXING workflow, not a reporting workflow. No report files will be created.
